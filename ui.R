The web app provides 2 types of analysis: rainfall and flow. For the rainfall analysis, the app provides the cumulative rainfall depth, rainfall duration, average rainfall intensity, and the maximum rainfall intensity over a 5-min or 10-min duration within a monitored event based on a user-uploaded hydrograph. For the flow analysis, hydrograph statistics determined by the web app include the total runoff volume, runoff duration, and peak (maximum) flow rate. If multiple hydrographs are provided for a single event, for example representing BMP inflow, outflow, and bypass, additional statistics are determined."

            into the downloaded template. 
            It is important to note that the rain gauge values must be entered into the designated rain column within the template.

            Flow data should be copy-pasted from a user's datasheet to the 
            downloaded data template. Up to four flows can be accomodated for analysis. The available flow types are inflow 1, inflow 2, outflow and bypass. Refer to the Methods tab for an illustration of the possible flow type configurations.
